    <h3>Hometown</h3>
        <h4>I was born in Detroit, MI. Here are some fun facts about the city:<br /></h4>
        <li>Belle Isle opened in 1884, and is the largest island park in the United States. Belle Isle is home to an aquarium, conservatory and nature zoo.</li><br />
        <li>Detroit was the first city in the United States to pave a road making it easier for cars to travel from place to place. The first mile of concrete is located at Woodward Avenue between 6 Mile and 7 Mile roads in Detroit.</li><br />
        <li>During Prohibition in the 1920s, Detroit was an ideal place to smuggle and hide liquor. With its close proximity to Canada, taking the highway from Detroit was a piece of cake. The city was actually responsible for smuggling the most alcohol in the United States.</li><br />
        <li>Drinking Vernors is definitely a Michigan thing, and people outside of the state should be jealous they can't get ahold of the refreshing soft drink. Created in 1866 by James Vernor, a Detroit pharmacist, it is a staple in Michigan.</li><br />
        <li>A man named Berry Gordy created Motown in the late '50s. Popular motown musicians include Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson and Mary Wells. The city has always been known for its music, so it's no surprise that techno also originated in Detroit in the '80s.</li><br />
        <li>There are more than 136 bars and restaurants in Downtown Detroit.</li>
