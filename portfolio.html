<p>

    <h3><u>DevbuildLab5_3 - Used Car Lot</h3></u>
        <b>Task:</b> Hold information about Car inventory using a collection of Car objects, including a
        UsedCar subclass.<br /><br />
        <b>What will the application do?</b><br />
        <li>Display a set of at least 6 cars (at least 3 new and 3 used) along with Add and Quit
        options</li>
        <li>Let the user select one of the cars.</li>
        <li>Ask if they want to buy the car. Remove it from the list if they do.</li>
        <li>If they want to add a car, get the details, instantiate a new car of the appropriate type,
        and add it to your data collection.</li>
        <li>Keep looping until they choose to quit.</li>

    <h3><u>DevbuildLab3_2 - Shopping List</h3></u>
        <b>Task:</b> Make a shopping list application which uses collections to store your items.<br /><br />
        <b>What will the application do?</b>
        <li>Display a list of at least 8 item names and prices.</li>
        <li>Ask the user to enter an item name</li>
        <li>If that item exists, display that item and price and add that item and its price to
        the user’s order.</li>
        <li>If that item doesn’t exist, display an error and re-prompt the user. (Display the
        menu again if you’d like.)</li>
        <li>Ask if they want to add another. Repeat if they do. (User can enter an item more than
        once; we’re not taking quantity at this point.)</li>
        <li>When they’re done adding items, display a list of all items ordered with prices in
        columns.</li>
        <li>Display the average price of items ordered.</li>

    <h3><u>DevBuildLab4_2 - Movies</u></h3>
        <b>Task:</b> List movies by category.<br />
        <b>What will the application do?</b>
        <li>The application stores a list of at least 10 movies and displays them by category.</li>
        <li>The user can enter any of the following categories to display the films in the list that
        match the category: animated, drama, horror, scifi.</li>
        <li>After the list is displayed, the user is asked if he or she wants to continue. If no, the
        program ends</li>
